## Objectives

### Objectives

* Participants will understand the importance of thinking about the kidney when facing disease states such as diabetes, HSP and spina bifida.
* Participants will develop a plan for first steps evaluation and nephroprotection in the above mentioned disease states.

## Abstract

### Abstract

The kidney is affected by a variety of disease states.  Some are
intrinsically renal in origin but many are not.  The generalist can be
expected to see patients with diabetes, HSP or spina bifida in the
course of a normal practice.  All of these affect the kidney in
different ways.  This talk will cover the primary reno-protective
measures a primary care physician can employ to make sure the
patient's kidney will last as long as possible in these disease
states.

# Diabetes
\frame{\tableofcontents[hideothersubsections]}

## Diabetes in Children

### Diabetes in children

* Obesity is increasingly becoming a disease of younger and younger people.
* IDDM is most commonly linked to renal disease
* NIDDM is increasing in adolescents
* Proteinuria on urinalysis
* No edema on physical exam

<div class="notes" 
Should be sure learners know the difference between obesity and edema.
Should talk about the fact that IDDM is more commonly linked because the duration of disease is longer since it starts as a child.

## Clinical findings

### Microalbuminuria

* Can occur in both insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes
* Not massive proteinuria
	* protein:creatinine is low (usually total of 30-300mg albumin/g creatinine)
	* albumin is normal
* Due to protein leak at the tubule, not at the glomerulus
* Slow decline in GFR, leads to CKD over years
* Most patients present after years of diabetic disease - 15+

### Hematuria

* Unusual
* When present, think glomerular leak
* Adults have ticks and fleas - Think about other causes of renal disease - IgA, membranous, etc.
* Biopsy shows mesangial proliferation, glomerular sclerosis

## Renal protection

### Renal protection

* Consider ACEI to protect the tubules
* Monitor blood pressure and treat accordingly
* Control diabetes to slow progression of renal disease
	* Weight reduction
	* Lipid control (rarely needed in peds)
* No protein restriction (in peds)

### Monitoring

* Yearly screens for proteinuria in all diabetics
* q3 Month check of protein:creatinine ratio for patients with demonstrated proteinuria
	* Goal is less than 1000mg/day protein excretion (less than 500 is even better!)
* Blood pressure monitoring
* Follow potassium in patients on ACEI or ARB

## Presentation

### Presentation

* Palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia
* Arthritis/arthralgia
* Abdominal pain
* Renal disease

<!--Purpura (75% of patients) is gravity dependent as is the arthritis/arthralgia (just over 50-75% of patients).  
Often patients will also have edema which improves with elevating the edematous area, elevation will help the arthritis too. 
Abdominal pain can be accompanied by GI bleeding but massive GI bleeding is rare. (about 50% of patients)
Renal manifestations are non-nephrotic proteinuria and microscopic or macroscopic hematuria (25-50% of patients).-->

### IgAV Rash

### Dorsal hand edema

### Immunfluorescence

### Unusual manifestations

* Scrotal pain 
* Headache, seizures, encephalopathy
* Respiratory signs
* Keratitis and uveitis

<!--Scrotal pain, swelling, testicular pain and tenderness (2-38%), may mimic torsion.-->
<!--CNS manifestations - the vasculitis is in all organ systems, CNS may even have intracranial hemorrhage - keep in mind if the mental status suddenly deteriorates.-->
<!--CXRs in IgAV patients generally show mild interstitial changes with no significant respiratory symptoms.-->
<!--Eye manifestations are quite rare. If you see this think about other causes of the keratitis or uveitis.-->

## Management

### Management

* Maintain hydration, elevate edematous areas, etc.
* Treat pain
* Consider steroids
* Hospitalize

### Outpatient management

* NSAIDS - naproxen or ibuprofen
* Prednisone - rarely needed

<!--Steroids may improve symptoms but don't affect the clinical course.
NSAIDS do improve symptoms but watch renal function closely and be very careful if child has GI bleeding!-->

### Criteria for hospitalization

* Unable to maintain hydration
* Severe abdominal pain
* GI bleeding
* Mental status changes
* Limited self-care (secondary to joint pain)
* Renal insufficiency

### Monitoring

* 1/3 or patients will recur at least once
* Monitor urinalysis and BP weekly - q2w for the first 2 months after presentation
* Monitor monthly until 1 year after initial presentation
* Check BP and UA at annual well-child visits to monitor for adult disease onset
