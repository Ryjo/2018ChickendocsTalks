## Objectives

### Objectives

* Participants will understand the importance of thinking about the kidney when facing disease states such as diabetes, HSP and spina bifida.
* Participants will develop a plan for first steps evaluation and nephroprotection in the above mentioned disease states.

## Abstract

### Abstract

The kidney is affected by a variety of disease states.  Some are
intrinsically renal in origin but many are not.  The generalist can be
expected to see patients with diabetes, HSP or spina bifida in the
course of a normal practice.  All of these affect the kidney in
different ways.  This talk will cover the primary reno-protective
measures a primary care physician can employ to make sure the
patient's kidney will last as long as possible in these disease
states.

# Diabetes
\frame{\tableofcontents[hideothersubsections]}

## Diabetes in Children

### Diabetes in children

* Obesity is increasingly becoming a disease of younger and younger people.
* IDDM is most commonly linked to renal disease
* NIDDM is increasing in adolescents
* Proteinuria on urinalysis
* No edema on physical exam

<div class="notes" 
Should be sure learners know the difference between obesity and edema.
Should talk about the fact that IDDM is more commonly linked because the duration of disease is longer since it starts as a child.

## Clinical findings

### Microalbuminuria

* Can occur in both insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes
* Not massive proteinuria
	* protein:creatinine is low (usually total of 30-300mg albumin/g creatinine)
	* albumin is normal
* Due to protein leak at the tubule, not at the glomerulus
* Slow decline in GFR, leads to CKD over years
* Most patients present after years of diabetic disease - 15+

### Hematuria

* Unusual
* When present, think glomerular leak
* Adults have ticks and fleas - Think about other causes of renal disease - IgA, membranous, etc.
* Biopsy shows mesangial proliferation, glomerular sclerosis

## Renal protection

### Renal protection

* Consider ACEI to protect the tubules
* Monitor blood pressure and treat accordingly
* Control diabetes to slow progression of renal disease
	* Weight reduction
	* Lipid control (rarely needed in peds)
* No protein restriction (in peds)

### Monitoring

* Yearly screens for proteinuria in all diabetics
* q3 Month check of protein:creatinine ratio for patients with demonstrated proteinuria
	* Goal is less than 1000mg/day protein excretion (less than 500 is even better!)
* Blood pressure monitoring
* Follow potassium in patients on ACEI or ARB
